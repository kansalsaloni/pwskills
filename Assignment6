What is Emnet?

Emnet is a tool which help to write HTML code quickly and easily by using abbreviations.
For example: write ! and enter tab then it print the boiler plate of  html i.e, boiler plate contain baisc strucuture of html code such as html, head, meta and body.
Meta tag is a information about any information. For example car is a meta then information about car is meta information.
If we write head then it automatically write the head tag and also show abbreviations of head tag.

Their are different methods to write code easily and fastly.
If we want to write div that contain nav and nav consist 2 times li then we write as div>nav>li*2.

          <div>
             <nav>
                     <li></li>
                     <li></li>
              </nav>
           </div>

=>Parent- child  we used greater than symbol
=>Siblings        we used + symbol
=>Grouping        we used * symbol

For id of p tag class we can write as p#id1
        
        <p id="id1"></p>

For class of p tag class we can write as p.class1

        <p class="class1"></p>
